Warning! This is rpclib's unstable development branch. Not only that, but rpclib
project is experimental. You have been warned.

Overview
========

What is rpclib?
----------------

Rpclib is an easy to use python library for publishing services that uses various
protocols and transports. Currently, it supports WSDL 1.1 and SOAP 1.1 protocols
over either ZeroMQ or HTTP.

With a very small amount of code, rpclib allows you to write
a useful remote procedure call pack and deploy it using your transport of choice.

The official rpclib discussion forum can be found [here](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/soap).

See the [downloads section](http://github.com/arskom/rpclib/downloads) for related downloads.

Rpclib is a generalized version of a soap processing library known as soaplib.
The legacy versions of soaplib are also available in this repository. 
See [here](http://github.com/arskom/rpclib/tree/soaplib-0_8) for the stable soaplib-0.8 branch.
See [here](http://github.com/arskom/rpclib/tree/soaplib-1_0) for the stable soaplib-1.0 branch.
See [here](http://github.com/arskom/rpclib/tree/soaplib-2_0) for the stable soaplib-2.0 branch.

Features
--------
* Deploy services as WSGI applications
* Handles all (de)serialization
* On-demand WSDL generation
* Powerful customization features to support many use-cases
* Doesn't get in your way!!!

Runtime Requirements
--------------------
* Python 2.4 or greater
* A WSGI-compliant web server for http services. (CherryPy, WSGIUtils, Twisted, etc.)
* [lxml](http://codespeak.net/lxml/) for soap. (available through easy_install)
* [pytz](http://pytz.sourceforge.net/) (available through easy_install)

See the examples directory in the source distribution for deployment
examples. Rpclib services have been successfully run on the following web
servers:

* CherryPy 2.2
* Flup
* twisted.web (8.2, 9.0)
* WSGIUtils 0.9

Development Requirements
------------------------
* Most examples and tests require Python 2.5 or greater
* Twisted is required for `rpclib.test.interop.server.basic` and `rpclib.test.interop.server.static`.
